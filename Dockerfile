# every workflow automatically (which is why this never showed up
# there), so it must be set explicitly here.

# toolchain, absent from node:22-alpine by default) if that download
# fails - a transient network hiccup then hard-fails the whole build
# instead of just being slower. Installed unconditionally so the rare
# fallback path works instead of erroring out.

# involved (it's a workspace:* link to the schloss-ui submodule), so
